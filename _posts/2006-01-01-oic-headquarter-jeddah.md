The O.I.C. project takes in consideration the indications and suggestions the Master plan defines for overall the interested areas'interventions.

The vehicular entrance into the area will take place from the axis of penetration provided by the Master plan.

The vehicular flow inside the project's area is achieved through a ring that closes in the O.I.C.'s building and allows the access both to the ground and underground parking. From the underground parking there is a protect and secure way to go into the meeting's stipulated place.

The building is constituted of two basic elements, which "dialogue" each other: the Congress hall and the tower destined to offices where at high floors seats the distinguished presidency.

The building is oriented according to the main north-south axis.

Such orientation permits to "close" the building southwards protecting it from insolation and allowing natural lighting. Appropriate shielding structures will be used also on northern fa√ßade.

On northern side the building is characterized of a wide concave space in order to form an "aeration tower" with climatologic function. Its front side is mostly glazed.

The other front sides will be realized with ventilated walls and white marble panels as external finishing.

The building stands within a huge artificial expanse of water spread of gushing springs and surrounding of green palms and dense vegetation.

Inside the building and in each floor, there are two prayer areas, different from men and women, with its pertinents ablution zones. There is also a little Mosque at the top floor.

At the ground floor, in a privileged zone, is designed a Mosque oriented towards Mecca.

The surrounding area includes the ground parking as well as a geometrical grid of green gardens, furnished with bowers, springs, blooming flowerbeds, and natural stone sitting areas.

Of particular importance are two broad areas destined to the collective prayer and oriented to the holy Mecca places.

The pedestrian external access is characterized by an arcade protected path that reflects on the expanse of water, passing under the big Congress' hall.

The Congress' hall will be connected to the main building trough a tensile structure covered passage.

In the building's interior it will be developed hanging gardens to decorate mainly meeting, restoration places and representative offices.

The privileged material for the structure, finishing and covering definition of spaces are stainless steel, marble and glass.

### SUSTAINABILITY

**Preliminary study**

The demand of a greater attention to the physical and mental comfort of the persons in the buildings is by now consolidated; the thermal comfort, visual, acoustic and the quality of the air is the objectives to pursue to guarantee adjust condition thermal hygrometric in the closed environments. The environmental and energetic cost of the building so "thought" has to be "content" creditable to the use of energetic efficient plants and/or solutions innovative and/or material structural that guarantee a suitable heat insulation of the building, whose performances, today, is able be "preventively" appraise with sophisticated tools of calculation. In the proposed project present is hypothesized the use of the system of double-skin facades (natural ventilation) to horizontal channels ("facade corridor") placed side by side by a suitable system of solar screening and from a wrap in marble. The obtainable benefits are in energetic terms that of thermal comfort it has been analyzed with the software ESP-r.
